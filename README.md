# AHK GDIp library compilation.
This is a compilation of user contributed functions for the GDIp library wrapper 
made by Tariq Porter [tic] that never made into it.

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/mmikeww/AHKv2-Gdip/ .
Unfortunately, some of the newly added functions are likely not
AHK v2 compatible, however I updated several functions to better
suit to it.

# History
- @tic created the original [Gdip.ahk](https://github.com/tariqporter/Gdip/) library
- @Rseding91 updated it to make it compatible with unicode and x64 AHK versions and renamed the file `Gdip_All.ahk`
- mmikeww's repository updates @Rseding91's `Gdip_All.ahk` to make it compatible with AHK v2 and also fixes some bugs
- this repository attempts to gather all the GDI+ functions contributed by various people that were missing
